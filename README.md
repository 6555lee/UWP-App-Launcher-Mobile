# UWP-App-Launcher
The whole point of this project is to provide the best traditional home screen experience as possible for Windows 10 devices. Also, some people despise Live Tiles so this is an alternative for them.

If you want to help out, you can fork the project to work on issues or add your own features that you'd think would be nice to include. Make sure that you do all your work and submit your pull requests to the prelease branch please.

It's completely fine if you copy this code and use it to make your own app launcher or for something different!
