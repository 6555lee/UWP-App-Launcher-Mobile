# UWP-App-Launcher
The whole point of this project is to provide the best traditional home screen experience as possible for Windows 10 devices. Some people hate Live Tiles so this is an alternative for them. Also, apps seem to load faster when opened with this launcher ðŸ˜Š.

## Contributing and using code:
If you want to help out, you can fork the project to work on issues or add your own features that you'd think would be nice to include. I suggest that you add any suggestions as an issue so to make it easier for people to collaborate. Make sure that you do all your work and submit your pull requests to the prelease branch please.

It's completely fine if you take this code and use it to make your own app launcher or for something different!


## Here are a list of awesome features currently available:
* Swipe right for Cortana (In case your wondering it's 100% inspired by swipe right for Google Now ðŸ˜‰)
* Add/change background image in settings
